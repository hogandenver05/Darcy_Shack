# Darcy_Shack
An online accesory shop

### The Why: 
For my final project in INF 286, Web Development, I was tasked to team up with two of my peers and redesign an existing website from the ground up. You can find that project [here](https://github.com/hogandenver05/Sustainiac_Redesign). I was also assigned with building a website of my choice. I chose to expand a project of mine I had started years ago, Darcy Shack, humbly named after my sister, Darcy. The purpose of the site was to serve as an online shop for handmade accesories (bracelets, necklaces, etc.) that she would make and sell to her friends at school. The project remained largely uncompleted after she refused to pay me to make it, until now! Enjoy!
